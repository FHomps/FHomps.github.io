      <p>I am very passionate about tabletop role-playing games. Both as a player and game master, I have had lots of fun over the years thanks to a hobby that's, all in all, not much more than an elaborate way of playing pretend.</p>
      
      <p>I want to share this fun with as many people as I can. Introducing Carbon.</p>

      <h1>What is Carbon?</h1>
      <p>Carbon is a universal tabletop role-playing game system I have been working on since 2017.</p>
      
      <p>Much like the element it shares its name with, Carbon is meant to be a lightweight skeleton for organic experiences to develop on. The system is mainly geared towards one-shot sessions or short campaigns, and is well-suited to new players and GMs. It features:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>Light rules</b>: the core rulebook is only ten pages long.</li>
        <li><b>Streamlined character creation</b>: write the keywords that define your character on Carbon's single-page character sheet, and you are basically good to go.</li>
        <li><b>Fast-paced play</b>: actions all follow the same dice-roll mechanism, and Carbon's catalyst system gives you shortcuts to quicken action resolution.</li>
        <li><b>Easy homebrewing</b>: Carbon is free and open-source. The manual and character sheet are web-based, and the code is hosted on my GitHub, making it easy to modify to your liking.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>You can find much more information about Carbone - including tips on whether or not it will fit your style of play - in its manual.</p>
      
      <p><b>Happy playing!</b></p>
